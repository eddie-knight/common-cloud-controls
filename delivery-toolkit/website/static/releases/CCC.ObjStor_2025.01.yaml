    title: Object Storage
    description: |
        Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects,
        rather than as files or blocks. Each object contains the data itself,
        metadata, and a unique identifier, making it ideal for storing large amounts
        of unstructured data such as multimedia files, backups, and archives. It is
        highly scalable and often used in cloud environments due to its flexibility
        and accessibility.

          objective: |
            Ensure that all objects stored in the object storage system have a
            retention policy applied by default, preventing premature deletion
            or modification of objects and ensuring compliance with data retention
            regulations.

                When an object is uploaded to the object storage system, the object
                MUST automatically receive a default retention policy that prevents
                premature deletion or modification.

                When an object is modified, the service MUST assign a new unique

      title: Automated Enumeration and Reconnaissance by Non-human Entities
      description: |
        Automated processes or bots may be used to perform reconnaissance by
        enumerating resources such as APIs, file systems, or directories. These
        activities can reveal potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or
        unsecured resources, which might result in unauthorized access or data
        exposure.
