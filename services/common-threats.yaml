    title: Unauthorized access through elevated privileges
    description: |
      An attacker can exploit misconfigured access controls to gain
      unauthorized access to sensitive resources by granting excessive privileges.

    title: Vendor-hosted keys are compromised
    description: |
      The service uses a vendor-hosted key management service (KMS) to manage
      encryption keys. Insider threats or mistakes can result in access by a
      threat actor.

    title: Attacker intercepts data in transit
    description: |
      The service allows unencrypted communication (e.g., HTTP). An attacker
      can intercept traffic between clients and the service to read or modify
      the data during transmission.

    title: Attacker encrypts data with client-managed keys
    description: |
      The service provides encryption mechanisms, but the encryption keys are
      managed by the client. An attacker with access to the service can encrypt
      the data, rendering it inaccessible without the decryption key they hold.
      Additionally, an attacker may alter the encryption key management settings
      to prevent access to data.

    title: Actors in known dangerous regions attempt to access data
    description: |
      The service is deployed in a region with known geopolitical risks. An
      attacker in that region may attempt to access the resource by exploiting
      privileged network access or other vulnerabilities.
    features: # TODO: Something about multi-region deployment?

    title: Accidental or malicious deletion of critical data
    description: |
      Critical data can be deleted either through accidental action by authorized users 
      or through malicious intent by threat actors exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

    title: Corruption or deletion of access logs by malicious actors covering their tracks
    description: |
      A malicious actor may attempt to corrupt, delete, or disable access logging to avoid detection 
      and erase evidence of unauthorized or malicious activity. This can prevent security teams 
      from identifying the full scope of the breach or tracking the attackerâ€™s actions.

  - id: CCC.TH08
    title: Deliberate targeting of single-zone or single-region vulnerabilities
    description: |
      An attacker may exploit the lack of multi-zone or multi-region replication to cause permanent data loss by 
      triggering a failure or disaster in a single zone or region. Without replication, this targeted attack 
      could result in significant data loss for critical systems.

    title: Automated scripts or bots may enumerate resources to identify weaknesses or sensitive data
    description: |
      Non-human entities, such as automated scripts or bots, may perform enumeration activities 
      to map out resources, identify security weaknesses, or locate sensitive data for exploitation. 
      This reconnaissance is often a precursor to a more significant attack.
