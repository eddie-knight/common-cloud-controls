    title: Vendor-hosted keys are compromised
    description: |
      The service uses a vendor-hosted key management service (KMS) to manage
      encryption keys. Insider threats or mistakes can result in access by a
      threat actor.

    title: Attacker intercepts data in transit
    description: |
      The service allows unencrypted communication (e.g., HTTP). An attacker
      can intercept traffic between clients and the service to read or modify
      the data during transmission.

    title: Attacker encrypts data with client-managed keys
    description: |
      The service provides encryption mechanisms, but the encryption keys are
      managed by the client. An attacker with access to the service can encrypt
      the data, rendering it inaccessible without the decryption key they hold.
      Additionally, an attacker may alter the encryption key management settings
      to prevent access to data.

    title: Resource exhaustion
    description: |
      An attack or misconfiguration can consume all available resources, such
      as memory, CPU, or storage, to disrupt the service or deny access to 
      legitimate users. This can be achieved through repeated requests,
      resource-intensive operations, or the lowering of rate/budget limits.
      Through auto-scaling, the attacker may also attempt to exhaust
      higher-level budget thresholds to impact other systems in the same scope.

      Alternately, attackers may flood the system with notifications to
      obfuscate another attack or overwhelm the service to disrupt 
      legitimate operations.
