    title: Data Leakage
    description: |
      Data leakage refers to the accidental or deliberate exposure of sensitive data from MLDE environments. This can occur through unauthorized downloads, unsecured network access, or improper sharing of files.
    features:
      - CCC.MLDE.F03 # Data Encryption
      - CCC.MLDE.F04 # Network Security
    mitre_technique:
      - T1030 # Data Transfer Size Limits

  - id: CCC.MLDE.TH03
    title: Service Disruption
    description: |
      Service disruption involves any event or series of events that prevent MLDE services from functioning properly, often caused by resource exhaustion, malicious activity, or technical failures.
    features:
      - CCC.MLDE.F05 # Monitoring and Logging
      - CCC.MLDE.F06 # Resilience Mechanisms
    mitre_technique:
      - T1499 # Endpoint Denial of Service

  - id: CCC.MLDE.TH04
    title: Unexpected Nondeterministic Behavior
    description: |
      This threat occurs when MLDE instances exhibit behavior that was not anticipated, due to improper configurations, unpatched vulnerabilities, or the introduction of malicious code.
    features:
      - CCC.MLDE.F07 # Configuration Management
      - CCC.MLDE.F08 # Patch Management
