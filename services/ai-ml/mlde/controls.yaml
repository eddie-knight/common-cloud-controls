    title: Define Access Mode for MLDE Notebooks and Instances
    objective: |
      Ensure that access to machine learning development environments (MLDE)
      resources is strictly defined and controlled. Only authorized users with
      appropriate permissions can access these environments, ensuring data and
      system integrity, and mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, data
      leakage, or service disruption.
