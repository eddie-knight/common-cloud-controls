# Common Cloud Controls Contribution Policy

This document provides the contribution policy for any changes to the
Common Cloud Controls (CCC) specification and documentation.

## Contributions

CCC reviews and merges changes to the repository via pull requests (PRs). Refer to the 
[GitHub PR Documentation] for more information about how to create a PR.

PRs that are not marked as `Draft` using the GitHub interface must be reviewed by the CCC
community in a timely manner, respective to the size of the contribution.

Contributors are asked to restrict pull requests based on the type of work being contributed.
For example, content revisions and new additions should each be in separate PRs (even if they are on the
same changed file) unless the revision and addition are dependent on each other.

### Reviews

Anyone may provide feedback or ask questions on pull requests by commenting through the GitHub
interface. Approvals and Requests for Changes may be made by members who have the appropriate
permissions in `CODEOWNERS`.

## Issues

GitHub Issues are used as the primary method for anything related to CCC that requires input from
multiple stakeholders, documentation, and a clear record of decision-making processes.

In conformance with FINOS anti-trust policy, issues must also be used to publicly document the
attendance, agenda, and minutes of publicly scheduled Steering and Special Interest Group meetings.

### Issue Resolution

Issue creators are advised to present the issue on the relevant community call and tag the appropriate
individuals in the issue for consideration.

All issues against the repository should be resolved in a timely manner.

PRs that are inactive for an extended period may be closed as stale. Issues may be reopened by an approver
after being closed as stale. Approvers are advised to provide guidance on how to progress or resolve a
stale issue when reopening it.

Issues use for meeting minutes should be reviewed and closed at the beginning of the next public session 
held by the respective group.
