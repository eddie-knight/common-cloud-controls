<img height="100px" src="https://github.com/finos/branding/blob/master/project-logos/active-project-logos/FINOS%20Common%20Cloud%20Controls%20Logo/Horizontal/2023_FinosCCC_Horizontal.svg?raw=true"/>

FINOS Common Cloud Controls (FINOS CCC) is an open standard project incubating in FINOS to describe
consistent controls for public cloud services that are compliant with common regulatory controls for
the financial services sector.

This standard is a cross-industry collaboration which aims to develop a unified set of cybersecurity,
resiliency, and compliance controls for common services across cloud service providers (CSPs).

## Getting Started

The CCC Standard is currently under construction, and not yet ready for end user consumption. The
community mailing list will be notified when a release candidate is ready for end user feedback.

If you would like to provide topically scoped end user feedback while development is ongoing, join
or propose the creation of a [User Group] within a [SIG].

To contribute to the standard as a governance, regulatory, compliance, or cybersecurity professional, consider joining a [SIG] community meeting.

### Join the Community Mailing List

CCC communications are primarily conducted through the community mailing list. Simply email
[ccc-participants+subscribe@lists.finos.org] to be automatically added.

### Join a Special Interest Group

A CCC Special Interest Group ([SIG]) is your first port of entry to contribute to the standard.
Review the [governance documentation] for more information about CCC community groups, roles,
and their respective responsibilities.

| SIG Name | Description | SIG Lead |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Cybersecurity | Responsible for everything related to cybersecurity controls in the CCC standard | SIG Lead TBD |
| Multicloud Portability | Responsible for the definition and maintenance of controls related to the minimum neccessary features required for a service to be considered portable across CSPs | SIG Lead TBD |
| Regulation Compliance | Works with other SIGs, regulatory bodies, CSPs, and others to ensure the proper integration of regulatory considerations in CCC | SIG Lead TBD |
| Specification Design | Works with other SIGs as well as end users to ensure that the specification format and presentation is suitable for all use cases | SIG Lead TBD |

Once you find the SIG you're interested in, review their charter for more information about their meeting times, or find the next meeting on the [FINOS Community Calendar]. You may also browse [past meeting minutes] to get up to speed with the latest happenings.
