# Common Cloud Controls Community Governance

This document outlines the principles, entities, and relationships that exist within the Common Cloud Controls (CCC) community. This includes the roles that individuals may have, and the groups that organize them.

## Principles

---
### Consensus Gathering

Some group charters may dictate circumstances where formal voting is necessary to facilitate informed decision-making by specific individuals. Only the steering committee may restrict voting or candidacy eligibility based on FINOS membership.

All other groups within CCC must adhere to consensus-based due process requirements.  These requirements apply to activities related to the development of consensus for approval, revision, reaffirmation, and withdrawal of Community Specifications.  

Due process means that any person (organization, company, government agency, individual, etc.) with a direct and material interest has a right to participate by: 

1. Expressing a position and its basis,
2. having that position considered, and 
3. having the right to appeal. Due process allows for equity and fair play. The following constitute the minimum acceptable due process requirements for the development of consensus.
---

**3.1.	Openness.**  Participation shall be open to all persons who are directly and materially affected by the activity in question. There shall be no undue financial barriers to participation. Voting membership on the consensus body shall not be conditional upon membership in any organization, nor unreasonably restricted on the basis of technical qualifications or other such requirements.  Membership in a Working Groupâ€™s parent organization, if any, may be required.

**3.2.	Lack of Dominance.**  The development process shall not be dominated by any single interest category, individual or organization. Dominance means a position or exercise of dominant authority, leadership, or influence by reason of superior leverage, strength, or representation to the exclusion of fair and equitable consideration of other viewpoints.

**3.3.	Balance.**  The development process should have a balance of interests. Participants from diverse interest categories shall be sought with the objective of achieving balance.

**3.4.	Coordination and Harmonization.**  Good faith efforts shall be made to resolve potential conflicts between and among deliverables developed under this Working Group and existing industry standards.

**3.5.	Consideration of Views and Objections.**  Prompt consideration shall be given to the written views and objections of all Participants.

**3.6.	Written procedures.**  This governance document and other materials documenting the Community Specification development process shall be available to any interested person.
