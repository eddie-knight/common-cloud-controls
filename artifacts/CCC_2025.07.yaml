    title: Common Cloud Controls
    description: |
        Common Cloud Controls defines the foundational set of security controls
        and capabilities that are applicable across all cloud service categories.
        These controls establish baseline security requirements that should be
        considered for any cloud service deployment in financial services ecosystems.

      title: Logs are Tampered With or Deleted
      description: |
        Logs may be tampered with or deleted due to inadequate access controls,
        or misconfigurations. This can make it difficult to identify security
        incidents, disrupt forensic investigations, and affect the accuracy of
        audit trails.

      description: |
        Event notifications may be intercepted due to misconfigurations,
        inadequate security measures, or unauthorized access. This could expose

      title: Event Notifications are Incorrectly Triggered
      description: |
        Event notifications may be triggered incorrectly due to misconfigurations,

        triggered unintentionally, obfuscate other issues, or overwhelm the
        system, potentially disrupting legitimate operations.

      title: Resource Constraints are Exhausted
      description: |
        Resource constraints, such as memory, CPU, or storage, may be exhausted
        due to misconfigurations, or excessive resource consumption. This could
        disrupt service availability, deny access to users, or impact other
        systems within the same scope. Exhaustion may occur through repeated
        requests, resource-intensive operations, or lowering rate/budget limits.
